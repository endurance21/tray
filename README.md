         HOW TO USE IT
```

```
First Register and then Login  IT WILL REDIRECT YOU TO HOMEPAGE 
```

```
EITHER CHOOSE [CREATE GROUP] OR [JOIN GROUP]
```
```
Choosing [CREATE GROUP] will make you ADMIN and you will get  a  UNIQUE GROUP CODE after you select CANTEEN and  ORDER NAME 
```
```
register another User at [ http://localhost:3000/  ] in  another Browser or in incognito mode at  of same browser and this time SELECT [JOIN GROUP] option 
and put the GROUP CODE you get from earlier process and yo! you are now part of that group
```
```
now in LHS of screen you get items to select and submit you ORDER
if you are admin  you can see all the orders placed by all the members joined in that GROUP 
NOW you know the whole order and also 
so the problem is solved and now you can sum up the order and submit it to CANTEEN OwNER
```
